# Praetorian Machine Learning Challenge
This is my personal submission for the praetorian machine learning cyber challenge. <br>
DO NOT RIP PARTS OF THIS CODE FOR YOUR OWN SUBMITION. <br>
The only portion of this code you may use directly is my neural network training data set found in the /data folder. It contains a large amount of architecture slices and their identification. You can use this to train your AI and hone your parameters, but be warned, you will need a powerfull computer to work through it.<br>
Ripping code will most likely disqualify your submition.<br>
This is a public repository for the sole purpose of allowing others attempting the challenge to view an example and determine a starting point.<br>
Web interface currently under development.<br>
