# Praetorian Machine Learning Challenge
This is my personal submission for the praetorian machine learning cyber challenge. <br>
DO NOT RIP PARTS OF THIS CODE FOR YOUR OWN SUBMITION. <br>
Ripping code will most likely disqualify your submition.<br>
The only portion of this code you may use directly is my neural network training data set found in the /data folder. It contains a large amount of architecture slices and their identification. You can use this to train your AI and hone your parameters, but be warned, you will need a powerfull computer to work through it.<br>
This is a public repository for the sole purpose of allowing others attempting the challenge to view an example and determine a starting point.<br><br>
To view command-line documentation view README_SCIPIO.txt and README_AENEAS.txt<br><br>
Web interface currently under development.<br>
To view the web interface:<br>
install Node.js <br>
navigate a terminal to web-interface/scipio<br>
run commands:<br>
-npm install<br>
-ng serve<br>
then resolve any package issues by installing the requested packages<br>
navigate your browser to localhost:4200<br>
the interface is developed for high resolution monitors<br>
it is currently under development<br>
